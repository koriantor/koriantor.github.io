			<p class="description">I went through my folder of cool art from the internet and found this.  Thought it'd be funny if the sun was my head, so I photoshopped it there.  Then I made added a color gradiant overlay so the color of my head would blend in naturally with the colorscheme.

			<p class="description">I modified an RGB image shifter.  The script splits the image into RGB channels and then shifts them by a few parameters (shift horizontally, shift vertically, number of times to shift, should it recursively call, etc).  I ran the script on a picture with a bunch of different parameters.  Then I took some good ones and made a gif out of it in gimp.

			<p class="description">There's a technique called pixel sorting that takes all the pixels on a line and sorts them by a value (e.g. how bright the pixel is).  A while back I found a script and made some modifications to it to help me find the most interesting pixel sorts.  This is me in front of Jackson Pollock's "Autumn" in NYC with some pixel sorts.  There are 3 layers: An overlay filtered me, a horizontal pixel sort, and a vertical pixel sort.
